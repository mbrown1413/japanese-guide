Learinng a Language I sometimes hear people say things like \"I can't learn a language, I'm just not good at languages\". Those people either haven't put in the time and effort, or they've tried learning but didn't go about it in an effective way. Learning a language is hard. It takes a long time. But anybody can do it if they put in the time and effort. You can learn anything, but you can't learn everything. You can learn a new language, you can learn to play an instrument, you can learn to juggle, you can learn to paint. You can learn any of those things if you choose to... but you may not have time to learn all of those things. Choose what you want to put your time and effort into. Sometimes it will feel like you aren't making progress. I promise you'll keep making progress if you keep at it though. Focus on your weakest point and eventually you'll be able to look back at realize how much you've improved. SRS SRS stands for \"Spaced Repetition System\". It's basically an electronic flashcard system. Once you learn a bit of information, or \"card\", it goes into a \"deck\". The SRS will show you that card later to see if you remember the answer. If you get it correct, you will see that card less often, but if you get it wrong you'll see it more often. Examples of SRS: Anki - Very flexible but can be difficult to use. Kitsun - Easy to use, but less flexible than Anki. WaniKani - Kanji-specific SRS website. Bunpro - SRS for Japanese grammar. SRS works best if keep up with reviews every day. Don't do lessons too quickly, as the reviews for those items will swap you later. Mnemonics A mnemonic is any technique that helps you remember something. If you're ever having trouble with a particular word, kanji, grammar point, or anything really, you should take some time to think of a mnemonic so you don't forget next time. Here's just a few types examples to give you an idea: \u308f, the hiragana character pronounced \"wa\" looks like a woman with a pregnent belly. I imagine the baby crying \"Waaaa!\" \u4eba, the kanji for \"person\", looks looks like a person standing \u5927, the kanji for \"big\", looks like a person holding out their arms saying how big something is. Story-based mnemonics are best when they're memorable. Mnemonics are often more effective if it's something personal to you, or something you came up with on your own. You'll get in the habit of coming up with your own mnemonics and over time you'll start doing it without thinking.","title":"Advice"},{"location":"advice/#advice","text":"General advice for learning.","title":"Advice"},{"location":"advice/#learinng-a-language","text":"I sometimes hear people say things like \"I can't learn a language, I'm just not good at languages\".

This is partially based on the Tofugu Guide , with more specific resources I recommend and my advice on how to use them. (my only major disagreement with the Tofugu guide is that you should not wait to learn grammar until you know a lot of Kanji.) Who is this guide for? This guide is for people who would like to progress their Japanese ability past a basic level and consume material written for native audiences. It should be useful for people at any stage of their learning, from absolute beginner to intermediate. My personal focus has been on reading, but I've tried to make the guide generic enough that it applies if you're learning to watch anime, or learinng to speak. Phase 1: Alphabets Goal : Learn the basics you will need to learn words and grammar in the next phase. Time : A few days to a few weeks. Aim to get past this stage as fast as possible. This is the boring basics you have to get down before you learn anything interesting. If you spend too much time perfecting your skills here, you'll get bored and quit. Hiragana and Katakana Hiragana and Katakana are both phonetic alphabets. That means you can always tell exactly how to pronounce something based on how it's written. Hiragana is the alphabet that's used the most. Katakana is used mainly for loan words (words borrowed from other languages). Compared to learning vocabulary, there is not much to learn for hiragana and katakana. You may get overwhelmed at first, but there is only so many letters to learn. What to learn - It's essential to be able to recognize all of the hiragana characters, but at this stage you don't need to be able to recall them with 100% accuracy. Being able to read hiragana quickly and accurately will come over time, after you actually use it for a while, and you'll be using it a lot. You should be somewhat familiar with katakana too, but is less important at this stage since it isn't essential for moving on to learning grammar. How to learn - There are tons of guides out there with mnemonics. Just pick one that clicks with you. Online guides: Tofugu: Learn Hiragana Tofugu: Learn Katakana Online charts: Hiragana Table from the Wikipedia article on Hiragana Katakana Table from the Wikipedia article on Katakana Use mnemonics Learning to write the hiragana and Katakana can help you remember them very well. Pronunciation While a lot of sounds in Japanese are the same as English, some are subtly different. It's much better if you learn the differences early so you don't build bad habbits. Romaji - Avoid romaji when possible. Romaji is when the phonetic (hiragana / katakana) characters are converted into English letters (for example: \u3068\u3046\u304d\u3087\u3046 \u2192 Tokyo). It might seem easier at first, but it can lead you to pronounce things incorrectly. I promise, once you get more experience it will actually be much easier to read hiragana than romaji. How to learn Tofugu: Japanese Pronunciation Typing Even if you don't have anything you want to type yourself, you'll need to type in order to look up words in the dictionary. You'll also need to type in Japanese when asking questions when you get to the immersion phase. How to learn Tofugu: How to install a Japanese Keyboard Tofugu: How to type in Japanese Despite my advice in the \"Pronunciation\" section about avoiding romaji, I think it's okay to type Japanese on a keyboard with English letters. If you type on a phone, you should at least try the \"flick\" input method. It has a higher learning curve, but it can be easier when you get used to it. What about Writing? - You probably don't need learn writing with pencil and paper. This is because unless you have a specific interest in something, like calligraphy, you probably won't ever need to write. Phase 2: Words and Grammar Goal : Learn basic words and grammar. Time : 1-3 months You can really finish this phase and move on to immersion as quickly as you want, as long as you learn the very basics of grammar. However, if you don't learn enough grammar now, your immersion experience will be too painful to get through, looking up every single thing as you come across it. Kanji Kanji are not hard to learn, there are just a lot of them. What to learn for each kanji What it looks like (you should be able to recognize it when you see it) What it means Common readings (pronunciations) of the kanji A few common words it is used in - This helps solidify your knowledge of the kanji. It also introduces you to many patterns in how words are formed, which will make it easier to learn words in the future. You do not need to learn to write any kanji by hand, unless you really want to. Although learning to write kanji is the best way to remember them, it takes a long, long time, and there are a lot of kanji. How to learn - Do whatever clicks with you, and make a habit of it. Here are some suggestions: Tofugu: Learn Kanji with Radicals and Mnemonics WaniKani - I recommend at some point finishing the first 10 levels (but you don't need to do this before moving on to immersion). WaniKani Anki Deck - Free Anki deck that follows WaniKani How much to learn - At this stage, you just need to get into a routine of learning kanji slowly over time. Kanji is useful for sure, but until you get to more advanced material, it's not essential. You don't really need kanji to jump into the immersion phase, since any reading you start out with will have furigana , small katakana letters above the kanji telling you how to pronounce them. Grammar Japanese grammar is very logical. There are exceptions, but unlike English there are very few of them. The difficult part is how different Japanese grammar is from English. Textbooks and courses can be difficult to get through. Try to understand the grammar explanations but don't worry about having a 100% understanding, and don't worry about getting the exercises perfect. You'll solidify your grammar knowledge later when you get a lot of exposure to it through immersion. Expect to come back to the grammar explanations later in your journey before they make complete sense. How to learn - Choose a course or textbook and get started. Try a few of them first to see what clicks. Personally, I recommend using both Cure Dolly and Bunpro. Bunpro also pairs well with other online or textbook courses. I've used Genki, but textbooks don't hold my attention. Online Cure Dolly: Japanese from Scratch This is my recommendation on where to start. Her explanations are logical and easy to follow. Some people hate her voice. Just turn on subtitles so you can understand it. Her explanations are really worth it. Bunpro - An SRS for grammar. You learn grammar points then you're quizzed by fill in the blank sentences. I recommend going in \"Bunpro Grammar Order\" rather than choosing a textbook \"path\". Bunpro order is pretty good, and gradually increases the difficulty of the sentences. They have good explanations of grammar points you should read through and understand before completing the lesson. Imabi - Free online course. Has a reputation for being dense, but some people really like it. Textbooks Genki - The most popular Japanese textbook. The biggest criticism is that it teaches polite verb forms first. If you're looking to read manga, you'll be using plain verb forms a lot more, so you'll either need to finish around chapter 8/9, or learn these on your own before reading. Tokini Andy - Videos following along Genki volume 1 and 2. Toriba - Another popular textbook. I haven't used this, but I've seen it highly recommended. How much to learn - Before moving on to immersion, I recommend you: Learn basic grammar - One of the following will do: Cure Dolly - Finish through lesson 22, or Genki - Finish through chapter 8/9. Specifically, before moving on you should know: \u3060 and \u3067\u3059 (copula / \"is\") Particles: \u304c, \u3092, \u306b, \u306f, \u3082, \u3067, \u306e (posession) Verb \u3066-form (connective) Verb \u305f-form (past tense) Both plain and polite verb forms \u306a vs \u3044 adjectives Negative verbs and adjectives Using \u3068 for quoting (with \u601d\u3046, \u8a00\u3046, etc.) \u3066 + \u3044\u308b (continuing actions) An idea of how to form simple sentences Phase 3: Immersion Goal : Start enjoying native material!! (but also keep studying kanji, grammar, and vocabulary) Time : 6 months or longer No matter what, this will be painful when you first start. You'll be looking up every other word in the dictionary, struggling to make sense of grammar, and struggling to figure out the meaning even when you know the grammar. This is perfectly normal. Everybody struggles when they first start immersion. Progress will be slow, but you will make progress, and after a few months you will be able to look back and see an improvement. You will get a lot of exposure to common words and grammar. You'll have to look up things you don't know. If something is common enough, you'll look it up enough times that you'll start to remember. It's typical to look up something a lot, maybe ten times, before being able to remember it. Personally, my first manga took me about an hour to get through a page. It was a real struggle at first, but after about 8 manga I felt pretty comfortable with basic grammar and I was reading a lot faster. Choosing Material Choose something that you enjoy. Remember how I said it will be difficult at first? You won't get through it if you don't choose something you enjoy. With that said, you'll need something simple enough to start out. Absolute Beginner Book Club - I highly recommend this to start out. You'll get people to answer even the most basic questions you have when reading. It's a great community of people who choose books for people who have learned some grammar but have never read native material before. Tolerating Ambiguity Try to understand what you can, but accept that some things are too advanced for you to grasp at the moment. Some concepts can only be absorbed through repeated exposure. How to look things up Words jisho.org - Online dictionary ichi.moe - Type in full sentences, and this will parse the Japanese into words and particles. TheJadedNetwork SFX Dictionary - Look up sound effects Grammar Bunpro - Even if you don't use this for SRS, you can look up grammar points here for free. Dictionary of Japanese Particles - Useful reference for particles when starting out. A Handbook of Japanese Grammar Patterns - Lots of good usage examples and very good explanations. Originally a Japanese grammar book that was translated into English. Make sure to get the English version! Dictionary of Japaneses Grammar - Recommended by many people. Definitely useful, but many of their explanations are hard to understand. 3 books - Basic / Intermediate / Advanced. Get \"Basic\" first. \"Intermediate\" and \"Advanced\" later. Tip: The index for each of the volumes is cumulative. Use the index in the \"Advanced\" book and it will tell you which page and which volume. Automatic translators - Only use these when you're really stuck, or you pretty much understand a sentence but want a hint about the nuance. They can sometimes be completely incorrect, so always take the results with a grain of salt. They don't produce a literal translation either, instead giving a \"natural\" sounding sentence. deepL - Often better than Google Translate Google translate Phase 4: Continuing Immersion Goal : Keep improving yourself by immersion, while also progressing on grammar and kanji. Time : Indefinite At this point, you're confident in basic grammar. You'll still be looking up grammar sometimes, and you'll still be looking up tons of words. It'll be a really long time before you can go through native material without a dictionary. But sometimes you'll be able to read through a whole page without looking anything up! You probably have enough experience to know how you learn best by now. You may want to follow a textbook all the way through, or keep going with bunpro only. You may want to learn a lot of vocab through SRS, or you may want to acquire vocab mostly through immersion. The important thing is to keep progressing in grammar and kanji, and you keep immersing yourself. Leveling Up TODO: Continuing the same series of books, anime, etc. will become easier as you get used to the words and patterns the auther uses. Switch to another series and you'll have to get used to a different style. That's how you learn though! Once you've consumed enough native material that you're comfortable with it, you should try something either more difficult (e.g. the beginner book club instead of the absolute beginner book club), or start focusing on a different area (e.g. speaking instead of reading). Different skills: reading, listening, speaking, writing. You'll get good at what you practice. If you want to start speaking, you need somebody (preferably a teacher) who will actually correct your mistakes. Vocabulary TODO: Kitsun vs Anki. You could also learn words completely through immersion. Intermediate plateau When you've learned all of the basics, you may feel like your progress slows. You've learned all the easy stuff, and now you know just how much there is to learn. The important thing to realize is that you are still learning as long as you're putting the effort in, it's just harder to see progress. Using WaniKani and Bunpro can help you look back on your progress to see how much you've learned. If you use SRS right, you'll start recognizing kanji, words, and grammar points in your reading.","title":"Guide"},{"location":"guide/#guide","text":"A guide for learning Japanese starting from absolutely nothing.

You may want to learn a lot of vocab through SRS, or you may want to acquire vocab mostly through immersion. The important thing is to keep progressing in grammar and kanji, and you keep immersing yourself.","title":"Phase 4: Continuing Immersion"},{"location":"guide/#leveling-up","text":"TODO: Continuing the same series of books, anime, etc. will become easier as you get used to the words and patterns the auther uses. Switch to another series and you'll have to get used to a different style. That's how you learn though! Once you've consumed enough native material that you're comfortable with it, you should try something either more difficult (e.g. the beginner book club instead of the absolute beginner book club), or start focusing on a different area (e.g. speaking instead of reading). Different skills: reading, listening, speaking, writing. You'll get good at what you practice. If you want to start speaking, you need somebody (preferably a teacher) who will actually correct your mistakes.","title":"Leveling Up"},{"location":"guide/#vocabulary","text":"TODO: Kitsun vs Anki. You could also learn words completely through immersion.","title":"Vocabulary"},{"location":"guide/#intermediate-plateau","text":"When you've learned all of the basics, you may feel like your progress slows. You've learned all the easy stuff, and now you know just how much there is to learn. The important thing to realize is that you are still learning as long as you're putting the effort in, it's just harder to see progress. Using WaniKani and Bunpro can help you look back on your progress to see how much you've learned. If you use SRS right, you'll start recognizing kanji, words, and grammar points in your reading.","title":"Intermediate plateau"},{"location":"material/","text":"Page last updated 2022-05-01 Material How to find native material for reading, listening, etc. Learn Natively - Community that collectively rates books based on their difficulty for Japanese learners. jpdb - Vocab lists sorted by difficulty for anime, visual novel, light novel, web novels, etc. Reading Avoid children's books.
