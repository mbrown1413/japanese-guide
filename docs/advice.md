## Learinng a Language

I sometimes hear people say things like "I can't learn a language, I'm just not
good at languages". Those people either haven't put in the time and effort, or
they've tried learning but didn't go about it in an effective way. Learning a
language is hard. It takes a long time. But anybody can do it if they put in
the time and effort.

You can learn anything, but you can't learn everything. You can learn a new
language, you can learn to play an instrument, you can learn to juggle, you can
learn to paint. You can learn any of those things if you choose to... but you
may not have time to learn _all_ of those things. Choose what you want to put
your time and effort into.

Sometimes it will feel like you aren't making progress. I promise you'll keep
making progress if you keep at it though. Focus on your weakest point and
eventually you'll be able to look back at realize how much you've improved.

## SRS

SRS stands for "Spaced Repetition System". It's basically an electronic
flashcard system. Once you learn a bit of information, or "card", it goes into
a "deck". The SRS will show you that card later to see if you remember the
answer. If you get it correct, you will see that card less often, but if you
get it wrong you'll see it more often.

Examples of SRS:
* [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) - Very flexible but can be difficult to use.
* [Kitsun](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) - Easy to use, but less flexible than Anki.
* [WaniKani](https://www.wanikani.com/) - Kanji-specific SRS website.
* [Bunpro](https://bunpro.jp/) - SRS for Japanese grammar.

SRS works best if keep up with reviews every day. Don't do lessons too quickly,
as the reviews for those items will swap you later.

## Mnemonics

A mnemonic is any technique that helps you remember something. If you're ever
having trouble with a particular word, kanji, grammar point, or anything
really, you should take some time to think of a mnemonic so you don't forget
next time.

Here's just a few types examples to give you an idea:
* わ, the hiragana character pronounced "wa" looks like a woman with a pregnent
  belly. I imagine the baby crying "Waaaa!"
* 人, the kanji for "person", looks looks like a person standing
* 大, the kanji for "big", looks like a person holding out their arms saying
  how big something is.

Story-based mnemonics are best when they're memorable. Mnemonics are often more
effective if it's something personal to you, or something you came up with on
your own. You'll get in the habit of coming up with your own mnemonics and over
time you'll start doing it without thinking.
