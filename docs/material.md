* [Learn Natively](https://www.learnnatively.com/) - Community that collectively rates books based on their difficulty for Japanese learners.
* [jpdb](https://jpdb.io/) - Vocab lists sorted by difficulty for anime, visual novel, light novel, web novels, etc.

## Reading

Avoid children's books. Children learn to speak first, so children's books
typically have no kanji, which actually makes it harder for us second-language
learners to parse sentences and recognize words. You'll want to get used to
reading kanji with furigana anyways.

* [WaniKani Community Book Clubs](https://community.wanikani.com/t/master-list-of-book-clubs/35283)
    * [Absolute Beginner Book Club](https://community.wanikani.com/t/absolute-beginners-book-club-currently-reading-%E3%83%8F%E3%83%94%E3%83%8D%E3%82%B9%E3%83%BBhappiness-next-prefecture-stories/34698) - Highly recommended to start here. You'll get people to answer even the most basic questions you have when reading.
* [Satori Reader](https://www.satorireader.com/) - Well curated set of content
  intended for Japanese learners.
    * Definitions and grammar explanations particular to the content.
    * Most content has audio too.
    * First few articles of each series is free.
    * Too difficult for absolute beginners.

### Graded readers

Graded readers are written specifically for language learners. They start out
very easy and slowly add new grammar. Some people really recommend graded
readers, but they can get very expensive, and they only work if they hold your
attention.

* [Tadoku](https://learnnatively.com/series/c78f246213/?sort=level) - Free series of graded readers
* level 0 and 1 graded readers from ASK publishing. Free ones are okay, the paid ones are expensive but very good.
